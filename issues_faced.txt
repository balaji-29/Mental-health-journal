What Happens Without Proper Setup of user model

No User Model: user_loader can’t create current_user, so @login_required always redirects to /login.
No get_id(): login_user fails with AttributeError (UserMixin prevents this).
No user_loader: Flask-Login can’t fetch the user, so current_user is None.
Weak SECRET_KEY: Session cookies can be forged (security risk).

In interviews, explain: “I used Flask-Login to store user IDs in signed session cookies, fetched via user_loader for secure journal access.”

month issue
for title i needed month name but for url redirect i needed month number


i have two records stored in mongodb for 14th sept and 23rd sept.
but 14th sept records are not displayed when i clicked. 23rd records are visible.
the issue is i'm fetching records for a week. 14th sept is end of the week.
 based on the condition records >= than start of the week && records <= end of the week will be fetched.
<= end of the week means 14-09-2025T00:00:00. but my record inserted time is 2025-09-14T22:05:13.271737+05:30.
so the end of the week records are getting skipped. i modified the code to take max time of end of the week record.
and the issue is resolved.
