\*Tech Stack in Detail
To keep it Python-centric and aligned with your skills (Python, Flask—note: Django isn't used here, but Flask is similar in spirit):

*Backend Framework: Flask – Handles routing, API endpoints, and request processing. Use blueprints to organize code (e.g., /journal for entries, /analytics for reports).
*Database: MongoDB (via PyMongo) – Flexible for unstructured text entries; alternatives like PostgreSQL if you prefer SQL.
Python Libraries:

*NLP: TextBlob or NLTK for sentiment.
*Encryption: cryptography (Fernet for symmetric keys).
*Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, Plotly.
*Data Handling: pandas for aggregation, NumPy for calculations.

*Frontend: Basic HTML/CSS with Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-responsive UI. Add JavaScript for dynamic elements (e.g., real-time entry previews).
*Deployment & Security: Deploy on Heroku or AWS. Use HTTPS, input sanitization (Flask-WTF for forms), and rate limiting to prevent abuse.
Testing: Pytest for unit tests (e.g., test sentiment functions); cover edge cases like empty entries or extreme sentiments.
